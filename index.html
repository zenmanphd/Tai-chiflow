            <h2>Welcome to Tai Chi Flow</h2>
            
            <p> You walk by the park and spot a mysterious figure off in the distance practicing 
                Tai Chi in the fading light of the afternoon. Though this unexpected sight is not 
                entirely unusual, their unbreakable focus and fluidity captures your full attention. 
                People performing Tai Chi have a way of blending in with the landscape. They capture 
                our imagination, and on some level, grant us a rare glimpse of peace. Sure, it's nice when you can practice and fully express your Tai Chi forms 
                out in the open, in a charming, beautiful place, BUT if you don't have access 
                to those places, that's ok too. Sometimes all you have is the alley behind the 
                steakhouse where you bartend. Perhaps the 10 x 10 ft cold, concrete space of your 
                laundry room is the only place to unleash the full power of Lao Jia Erlu (cannon fist). 
                If dandelions still bloom through the sidewalk cracks you can always find a Tai Chi corner.

            <h2>Benefits of Tai Chi Chuan</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I have to confess that tapping into this ancient art has been a 
                game changer for my overall physical, mental, and even spiritual well-being. 

                Tai Chi is a superior activity for physical recovery. Many of the movements 
                and forms cultivate an increased mobility, balance, agility, and general body 
                control. In fact there are a number of Tai chi exercises that are excellent for 
                improving proprioception (which is your body's awareness of itself when coordinating 
                movement.) It's an everyday phenomenon that we take for granted.
                
                Tai Chi is especially well suited as a form of moving meditation, especially 
                if you're like me and can't just sit still with your legs crossed and empty our 
                minds no matter how many French Vanilla scented candles we've lit.
                
                Look, there's nothing wrong with taking a moment out of your day to focus 
                your thoughts or even escape them and Tai Chi is up for the task.  </p>

            <h2>Invest in Basic Movements</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Alright, you've you've found the perfect time and picked out the perfect spot 
                to practice Tai Chi. So now what do you practice? I mean where do you even start? 
                That's what I'm here for my friends.

                I recommend rather than tackling a traditional form head-on, focus on the fundamental 
                movements of those sequences. If you were learning to speak Chinese you wouldn't just 
                recite random sentences you've memorized in whatever accent "just feels right." You need 
                to learn what each word means and how to properly pronounce them. In a sense, you're 
                trying to teach your body to speak Tai Chi Chuan. So now, I would like to share with 
                you a few examples of the kind of exercises you can practice. Each exercise is derived 
                from an original form. They are essentially phrases to aide in your fluency of  Tai chi.</p>
